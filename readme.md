# Health Data Management Smart Contract

This repository contains a Rust implementation of a smart contract for managing health data on a blockchain platform using the Soroban SDK.

## Overview

The smart contract consists of two main structs: `HealthData` and `DataConsent`. 

- **HealthData**: Stores health-related information including data type, value, and timestamp.
- **DataConsent**: Represents consent given by a user (owner) to a researcher for accessing specific health data for a defined duration.

## Contract Functions

Helper Functions
Several helper functions are provided to support the main contract functions:

get_next_data_id: Retrieves the next available data ID for a user.
get_data_owner: Retrieves the owner (user) of a specific piece of health data.
get_consent_key: Generates a unique key for storing consent data.
consent_for: Creates a DataConsent object for a researcher requesting access to specific data.
invoke_token_contract: Invokes a token contract to reward researchers for accessing health data.
Usage
To use this smart contract, developers can integrate it into their blockchain application by importing the HealthDataContract and implementing appropriate interactions with users and researchers.

Note
This implementation assumes the existence of a token contract for rewarding researchers. Developers may need to modify the invoke_token_contract function to integrate with their specific token contract.
